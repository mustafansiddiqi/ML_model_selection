# ML model selection
This repository contains a Python function I built while taking Machine Learning at the University of Chicago. The goal was to create a single, flexible function that can:

Detect whether a prediction task is classification or regression

Run a broad set of ML models automatically

Perform Grid Search cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning

Evaluate models using test error / MSE

Select the best-performing model

Report the confusion matrix for classification tasks

Output a clean summary table of all model results

This project was intended as a learning tool to help me see how models run and perform side by side.
